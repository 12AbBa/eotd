# Day 56: [Euler's identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler's_identity) (see also [π](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi))

$$ e^{i \pi} + 1 = 0 $$

After stating Euler's formula: e^(𝖎z) = cos(z) + 𝖎 sin(z), we must of course also talk about Euler's identity: e^(𝖎π) + 1 = 0. But there's one problem: how do we define the number π?

There are many ways to do this, but the most popular one is as follows: π is twice the smallest positive root of cosine. That is, if we let S be the set of all x > 0 such that cos(x) = 0, then π = 2 \* min S. Of course, many questions naturally arise: Why is S nonempty? Why must S have a minimal element?

To show that cosine has a positive root, we observe that cos(0) = 1 &gt; 0, and that
cos(2) = 1 - 2²/2! + 2⁴/4! - (2⁶/6! - 2⁸/8!) - (2¹⁰/10! - 2¹²/12!) - ... &lt; 1 - 2²/2! + 2⁴/4! = -1/3 &lt; 0.
Thus, since cosine is continuous, by the intermediate value theorem, cos(x) = 0 for some x ∈ (0,2). Next, to show that S has a minimum, we let m = inf S (that's the infimum, the greatest lower bound, the opposite of supremum). Then there exists a sequence of elements of S, say (s_n), that converges to m. Since cosine is continuous, cos(m) = lim cos(s_n) = 0. But m ≥ 0 by definition, and m ≠ 0 because cos(0) ≠ 0, so m ∈ S, hence m is the minimum element of S.

Now that we know that cos(π/2) = 0, we can compute cos(π) using the double-angle formula cos(2z) = 2cos²(z) - 1 (which can be proven by algebraic manipulation), giving cos(π) = -1. We also know that sin²(z) + cos²(z) = 1, so sin(π) = 0. If we then plug these values into e^(𝖎z) = cos(z) + 𝖎 sin(z), we get e^(𝖎π) + 1 = 0, Euler's identity!

By direct computation, we may show that sin(z + 2π) = sin(z) and cos(z + 2π) = cos(z), so sine and cosine are periodic with period 2π. And since e^(2π𝖎) = 1, the complex exponential is periodic with period 2π𝖎: e^(z + 2π𝖎) = e^z. These properties are certainly not obvious from the definition :D
